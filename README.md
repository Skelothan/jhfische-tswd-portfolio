# Telling Stories with Data Portfolio
This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU!  Here's where all my cool work will go.  You should probably hire me. 

## About me
I like video games and data from video games. Let's see if we can learn anything from the data and make cool charts with them.

## What I hope to learn
- I'd like to learn about less well-known data visualization types and when and how to use those types of charts.
- I'd also like to learn what software professionals use to make fancy charts, and learn to use those tools myself.
